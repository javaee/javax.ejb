The empty MANIFEST.MF is needed because of the way we have configured maven-jar-plugin 
and maven-bundle-plugin to interact with each other. We may be able to avoid it now, 
but that will require some effort. I have filed [1] and hopefully I will have some time 
to fix it in future. 

Thanks,
Sahoo
